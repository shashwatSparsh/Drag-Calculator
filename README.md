# Drag-Calculator
This Drag Calculator Project was created for the MAE 158: Aircraft Performance course for Winter Quarter, 2022 at the University of California-Irvine.
The project was designed by Professor J. Huynh and TA's Nabil Khalifa and Jessica De la Cruz.

The current iteration of this calculator as of 9th March 2022, is not robust in it's calculations as it utilizes no Oswald Efficiency Factor corrections for specific aspect ratios along with a simplified flat plate estimation to calculate skin friction drag for various components. In addition, there is no interpolation for calculating the efficiency factor; instead, the Coefficient of Profile Drag is rounded to the digitized curves for CDP = .01, .015, .02, .025. A more robust calculator will be introduced at a later point.
